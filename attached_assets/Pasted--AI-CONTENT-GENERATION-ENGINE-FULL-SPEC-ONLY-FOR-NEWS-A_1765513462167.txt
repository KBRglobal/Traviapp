AI CONTENT GENERATION ENGINE — FULL SPEC

(ONLY FOR NEWS ARTICLE GENERATION INSIDE THE CMS)

The AI system is responsible for generating a complete Dubai-travel-news article from only a title, or optionally a title + link + short source text.

The AI must follow ALL steps below, every time.

⸻

INPUTS THE AI MUST SUPPORT

⸻

The AI must be able to create a full article from ANY of these:
	1.	Title only
	2.	Title + short summary
	3.	Title + RSS feed item
	4.	Title + URL (system fetches source text)
	5.	Manual override text that the editor pastes

⸻

STEP 0 — INTERNAL ANALYSIS (NOT SHOWN IN OUTPUT)

⸻

AI performs a hidden internal analysis:
	1.	Identify Content Category (A–H):
	•	A Attractions & Activities
	•	B Hotels
	•	C Dining/Food
	•	D Transportation/Logistics
	•	E Events/Festivals
	•	F Tips/Guides
	•	G News/Regulations
	•	H Shopping & Deals
	2.	Identify urgency:
	•	Urgent (this week)
	•	Relevant (1–2 months)
	•	Evergreen
	3.	Identify expected traveler audience:
Families / Couples / Budget / Luxury / Business
	4.	Choose best personality from A–E bank
	5.	Choose tone (enthusiastic, practical, serious, enticing, friendly)
	6.	Identify unique angle that will make this article valuable
	7.	Select ideal article structure (1–6)
	8.	Select 3–5 marketing words (never more)
	9.	Select primary & secondary keywords

All internal — never shown.

⸻

STEP 1 — AI GENERATES ALL REQUIRED META + STRUCTURE DATA

⸻

AI outputs the following structured objects for the CMS:

meta:
	•	Auto meta title (50–65 chars)
	•	Auto meta description (150–160 chars)

	•	Selected structure #
	•	Selected category A–H

	•	Topic keywords (primary, secondary, long-tail, LSI)

These fields are shown to the editor and editable.

⸻

STEP 2 — ARTICLE GENERATION

⸻

The AI creates the complete article, ready for publishing.

Article structure must include:

1. H1 Title

SEO-optimized, human, clickable.

2. Opening Paragraph (The Hook)
	•	2–3 sentences
	•	Must include primary keyword
	•	Must answer: “What happened?” and “Why travelers should care?”

3. Section: Quick Facts Box

Auto-generated table including:
	•	Location
	•	Price or cost impact (if relevant)
	•	Hours
	•	Best for
	•	How to get there
	•	Time needed
	•	Booking/ticket notes
	•	Best time to go

4. Main Content Sections

Based on chosen structure.
All paragraphs must follow personality/tone selected.

Examples:
	•	News + Guide
	•	Story + Info
	•	Comparative
	•	Updates
	•	Lists

5. Pro Tip Section

AI must generate 1–2 genuine, not generic tips.

6. Good to Know

Warnings, restrictions, seasonality, local insights.

7. Optional: Sub-topics

If relevant, AI adds small sections H3/H2.

8. FAQ Section

AI generates 4–8 FAQ items:
	•	100–150 words each
	•	SEO-rich
	•	Must answer actual search intent
	•	Must be unique (no repetition)

9. Internal Links Suggestions

3–5 internal links with suggested anchor text.

10. Image ALT Suggestions

3 image alt texts:
	•	One for hero
	•	One for detail section
	•	One for atmosphere/photo

11. Final Thoughts / Closing

Short, practical, traveler-focused.

⸻

STEP 3 — SEO OPTIMIZATION RULES

⸻

AI must enforce:
	•	Keyword density: natural, not stuffed
	•	Avoid clichés
	•	Rotate vocabulary
	•	Maintain tone/personality
	•	Keep content factual & helpful
	•	Validate meta length
	•	Validate readability
	•	Validate that article length is 800–1800 words depending on complexity

⸻

STEP 4 — OUTPUT FORMAT FOR THE CMS

⸻

AI must output a JSON-ready object:

{
  "meta": {
    "title": "",
    "description": "",
    "slug": "",
    "keywords": [],
    "ogTitle": "",
    "ogDescription": ""
  },
  "analysis": {
    "category": "",
    "tone": "",
    "personality": "",
    "structure": "",
    "uniqueAngle": "",
    "marketingWords": [],
    "primaryKeyword": "",
    "secondaryKeywords": [],
    "lsiKeywords": []
  },
  "article": {
    "h1": "",
    "intro": "",
    "quickFacts": [],
    "sections": [
      { "heading": "", "body": "" },
      { "heading": "", "body": "" }
    ],
    "proTips": [],
    "goodToKnow": [],
    "faq": [
      { "q": "", "a": "" }
    ],
    "internalLinks": [
      { "anchor": "", "url": "" }
    ],
    "altTexts": [
      "",
      "",
      ""
    ],
    "closing": ""
  }
}

Absolutely no design — content only.

⸻

STEP 5 — TITLE-ONLY GENERATION MODE

⸻

When the user provides only a title, the AI must:
	•	Infer the type of story
	•	Build the entire internal analysis
	•	Choose category, tone, personality
	•	Generate the entire article based solely on world knowledge + contextual reasoning
	•	Fill all required fields
	•	Create a full, coherent article without needing a source text

⸻

STEP 6 — ULTRA-STRICT RULES

⸻

	•	No hallucinations about prices, laws, or dates (AI must say “as of latest public information” if unsure).
	•	No fake names, no invented quotes.
	•	Always traveler-focused.
	•	Always SEO-clean.
	•	Marketing vocabulary: maximum of 5 words per article.
	•	No duplicate sentences.
	•	No unnatural keyword stuffing.
	•	No promotional tone unless the story type requires it.

⸻

STEP 7 — EDITOR-FRIENDLY OUTPUT

⸻

AI must generate content that is:
	•	100% editable
	•	Broken into proper blocks
	•	Easy to modify per section
	•	Fully structured for CMS UI

⸻

STEP 8 — AUTO SUGGESTIONS FOR THE EDITOR

⸻

AI must automatically propose:
	•	Alternative headlines (3 versions)
	•	Alternative intro (2 versions)
	•	Alternative CTA (if relevant)
	•	Alternative Quick Facts (if missing data)

These appear in a “Suggestions” panel.

⸻

STEP 9 — ERROR HANDLING

⸻

If the title is vague or meaningless:
	•	AI must request clarification OR
	•	Generate the most likely Dubai-travel-related interpretation

⸻
