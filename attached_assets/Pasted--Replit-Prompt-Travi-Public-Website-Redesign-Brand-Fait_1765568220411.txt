🔹 Replit Prompt – Travi Public Website Redesign (Brand-Faithful)

Context

You are redesigning the public-facing Travi website only (homepage + category/listing pages + article layout).
Do NOT touch the CMS / admin system.
This is a visual + UX redesign, not a backend or feature rewrite.

The site currently works functionally but feels:
	•	too generic
	•	too grid-repetitive
	•	not expressive enough of the Travi brand

Your goal is to elevate it to a premium, playful, editorial travel brand, fully aligned with the official Travi Brandbook.

	2.	Image-first design
	•	Large hero images with gradient overlays
	•	Editorial featured cards
	•	Magazine-style article presentation
	3.	Clear visual rhythm
	•	Each section must feel distinct
	•	Vary background colors, spacing, and layout density

	•	Luxury, aspiration, discovery
	•	Think “editorial travel magazine”, not “booking directory”
