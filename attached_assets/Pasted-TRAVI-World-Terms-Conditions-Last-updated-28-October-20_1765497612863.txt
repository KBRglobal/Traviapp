1. Purpose & Scope of Use
TRAVI World is a digital media and editorial platform. We publish travel-related news, destination updates, guides, reviews, and curated outbound links to third-party providers (such as Booking.com, GetYourGuide, Viator, Skyscanner, and others). We do not sell any products or services directly and do not process bookings or payments. All third‑party transactions are governed by the third party’s terms.
Use of the Website is permitted for personal, non‑commercial purposes only and subject to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Cookie Policy, which are incorporated by reference.

2. Affiliate Disclosure & Third‑Party Transactions
Some links on the Website are affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and make a purchase or booking, we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you. We clearly disclose material connections and mark sponsored content, in line with the U.S. FTC Endorsement Guides and the EU Digital Services Act.
All bookings, purchases, and customer service matters are handled exclusively by the relevant third‑party provider. We are not a travel agent, booking service, payment processor, or travel provider. We do not control third‑party services and are not responsible for their acts, omissions, or policies. Direct any inquiries, complaints, cancellations, or refund requests to the applicable provider.
