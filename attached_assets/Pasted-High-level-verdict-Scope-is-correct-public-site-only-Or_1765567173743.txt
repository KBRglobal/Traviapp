High-level verdict

✅ Scope is correct (public site only)
✅ Order is correct (nav → shared components → homepage → listings → polish)
✅ Language is implementation-oriented, not conceptual
✅ Matches the screenshots and the real problem (template look, no hierarchy)

You are not missing a phase.
You do need to sharpen acceptance criteria so the dev doesn’t half-do it.

⸻

Small but important refinements (do these)

1. Phase 1 – Navigation (add one rule)

Your nav change is correct, but add this explicitly:
	•	Navigation must visually shift from “SaaS app header” → editorial site header
	•	This means:
	•	More breathing room
	•	Less boxy buttons
	•	Clear brand presence
	•	Sticky behavior optional, but not required

Without this sentence, devs often just add links and stop.

⸻

2. Phase 2 – Shared Components (this is the most critical phase)

You nailed this phase, but add one explicit rule per component so it doesn’t regress to generic cards.

Image-Based Hero
	•	Must support:
	•	Background image
	•	Gradient overlay (top→bottom or side→side)
	•	Text alignment variations (center / left)
	•	Must feel usable on:
	•	Homepage
	•	Listing pages
	•	(Later) detail pages

Featured Card
	•	Must visually dominate the page
	•	Must be at least 2× the visual weight of regular cards
	•	Must support:
	•	Image
	•	Title
	•	Short editorial description
	•	Single primary CTA

Editorial Card
	•	Must NOT look like the same card scaled down
	•	Different typography rhythm:
	•	Smaller image
	•	Stronger text hierarchy
	•	Calm hover (no aggressive motion)

This avoids the “everything is a card” trap.

⸻

3. Phase 3 – Homepage (very good, add one constraint)

Add this explicit constraint:
	•	No more than one grid section back-to-back
	•	At least one section must be:
	•	Text-led
	•	Or asymmetric (image + text)

This forces rhythm.

⸻

4. Phase 4 – Listing Pages (this is where differentiation must be obvious)

Your intent is correct. Make it enforceable:

Hotels
	•	Editorial tone: luxury, calm, spacing
	•	Fewer items per row
	•	Larger imagery

Attractions
	•	Visual density higher than Hotels
	•	More imagery, slightly tighter grid

News
	•	Text-first
	•	Featured article is dominant
	•	List below feels like a magazine index, not cards

If you don’t state this, devs reuse the same layout with color changes.

⸻

5. Phase 5 – Polish (good, but add one sanity check)

Add:
	•	Final pass must explicitly answer:
“Would a user immediately feel this is curated rather than generated?”

This sounds soft, but it’s a real bar.

⸻

FINAL — LOCKED ACTION PLAN (DROP-IN VERSION)

You can paste this back as your final answer.

⸻

Public Website Redesign – Execution Plan (UI Only)

Scope:
Public website UI only. CMS/admin system is final and out of scope.
No backend, API, or data changes.

⸻

Phase 1: Foundation & Navigation
	•	Implement public header navigation with:
	•	Attractions
	•	Hotels
	•	News (rename from Articles)
	•	Districts
	•	Dining
	•	Visually shift header from “app UI” to editorial site header:
	•	More spacing
	•	Clear brand presence
	•	Less SaaS-style chrome
	•	Update design tokens:
	•	Typography scale
	•	Spacing rhythm
	•	Color usage for a premium editorial feel

⸻

Phase 2: Shared Components (Critical)

Create reusable, non-generic components:
	1.	Image-Based Hero
	•	Background image + gradient overlay
	•	Headline + subheading
	•	Flexible alignment (center / left)
	•	Used across homepage and listing pages
	2.	Featured Card
	•	Visually dominant (clearly larger than others)
	•	Image, title, short editorial description, single CTA
	•	Used at top of listing pages
	3.	Editorial Card
	•	Magazine-style (not a scaled-down grid card)
	•	Strong typography hierarchy
	•	Calm hover states
	•	Used for secondary content

⸻

Phase 3: Homepage Redesign
	•	Full-width image hero with editorial headline
	•	Homepage sections must create rhythm:
	•	Featured attractions (large visual)
	•	Hotels section (premium styling)
	•	News/editorial section (text-forward)
	•	Avoid repeating grid layouts back-to-back
	•	At least one section must be text-led or asymmetric

⸻

Phase 4: Listing Pages

Redesign each listing page with a distinct personality:
	•	Hotels
	•	Luxury tone
	•	Fewer items per row
	•	Larger imagery and spacing
	•	Attractions
	•	Experiential, visual-first
	•	Slightly denser layout than Hotels
	•	News
	•	Editorial, text-forward
	•	One featured article
	•	Compact list below (magazine index feel)

All listing pages:
	•	Start with Image-Based Hero
	•	Include one Featured Card
	•	Then curated secondary content

⸻

Phase 5: Polish & Validation
	•	Refine typography hierarchy and vertical spacing
	•	Ensure no page feels like a template clone
	•	Final sanity check:
	•	Pages feel curated, editorial, premium
	•	Not autogenerated, not SaaS-like
