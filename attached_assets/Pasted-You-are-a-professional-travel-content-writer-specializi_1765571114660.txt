- "Once in a lifetime" (overused)
- "Paradise" (cliché)

❌ **DON'T use:**
- Overly promotional language
- Unmeasurable promises ("best in the world")
- Vague or inaccurate information
- Phrasing that sounds copied from a brochure
- Multiple marketing buzzwords in one sentence
- The same descriptive words in every article

💡 **The Humanity Test:**
Read the article aloud. If it sounds like a generic travel guide or brochure - change it! If it sounds like a knowledgeable friend sharing recommendations - you passed!

💡 **The Vocabulary Balance Test:**
Count your marketing/promotional words. More than 5 in one article? Too many. None at all? Missing opportunity. Sweet spot: 3-5, well-distributed, supported by facts.
