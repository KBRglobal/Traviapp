🎨 TRAVI – HOMEPAGE REDESIGN PROMPT

BRAND-LOCKED, UI-ACCURATE, EDITORIAL-FIRST

CONTEXT

You are redesigning ONLY the Travi homepage.
Do not redesign inner pages, CMS, or admin.

This is a full visual and structural redesign, not a refactor.

The goal is a premium, editorial, destination-first homepage for a Dubai travel brand.

⸻

1. BRAND SYSTEM — MUST BE APPLIED EVERYWHERE

Color Palette (STRICT)

Use ONLY these colors and their logical gradients:

Primary Gradient (Hero / Major Sections):
	•	#6C5CE7 → #A855F7 → #EC4899
(smooth diagonal or vertical gradient, subtle noise allowed)

Accent / CTA:
	•	#FACC15 (gold/yellow accent)
	•	#EC4899 (pink for secondary CTA or emphasis)

Neutrals:
	•	White backgrounds: #FFFFFF
	•	Light background sections: #F8FAFC
	•	Text primary: #0F172A
	•	Text secondary: #475569

❌ No random blues, greys, or Material defaults
❌ No muted corporate palettes

⸻

Typography
	•	Primary Font: Rounded, modern, friendly (Inter / Poppins style)
	•	Headlines: Bold, large, confident
	•	Body text: relaxed line-height, editorial feel
	•	Avoid “dashboard typography”

Hierarchy example:
	•	H1: very large, emotional
	•	H2: editorial section headers
	•	Body: readable, calm
	•	Labels: soft pills, rounded

⸻

2. HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY ORDER)

SECTION 1 — HERO (Above the Fold)

Purpose: Emotional hook. Brand statement. Not a search tool first.

Layout:
	•	Full viewport height
	•	Background: gradient (brand primary) + subtle texture/noise
	•	Centered content

Content:
	•	Small pill badge above headline
“✨ Your Dubai Travel Companion”
	•	H1 (2 lines max):
“Discover the Magic of Dubai”
	•	“Dubai” highlighted in gold (#FACC15)
	•	Short subheading (1 sentence):
“World-class hotels, iconic attractions, and expert travel guides — curated for you.”

Search:
	•	Large rounded search bar
	•	Placeholder:
“Search hotels, attractions, or guides…”
	•	CTA button: Search (pink or gold)

❌ No stats counters here
❌ No clutter
❌ No grid below hero

⸻

SECTION 2 — EXPLORE DUBAI (Primary Navigation as Cards)

Purpose: Replace boring menus with visual navigation.

Layout:
	•	Light background (#FFFFFF)
	•	Horizontal row of large rounded cards

Cards (exact order):
	•	Hotels
	•	Attractions
	•	Districts
	•	Articles (rename “News & Guides”)
	•	Dining
	•	Transport

Each card:
	•	Gradient icon circle (brand colors)
	•	Title
	•	Small count text (“500+ hotels”)
	•	Hover: subtle lift + glow

⸻

SECTION 3 — FEATURED / HOT RIGHT NOW

Purpose: Editorial curation, not listings.

Layout:
	•	White background
	•	Left-aligned section title:
“Hot Right Now”
	•	Subtitle:
“Trending places everyone’s talking about”

Content:
	•	ONE large featured card
	•	Image dominant (cinematic ratio)
	•	Overlay gradient
	•	Badges:
	•	“🔥 Trending”
	•	Rating
	•	Title
	•	One-line description
	•	CTA: “Explore”

❌ No grids
❌ No multiple cards here

⸻

SECTION 4 — POPULAR DESTINATIONS (Editorial Grid)

Purpose: Visual inspiration.

Layout:
	•	4-card horizontal grid
	•	Large images
	•	Soft rounded corners

Each card:
	•	Image
	•	Category badge (Hotel / Attraction / District / Dining)
	•	Rating
	•	Title
	•	Short teaser text

This should feel like a magazine spread, not ecommerce.

⸻

SECTION 5 — LATEST NEWS & GUIDES (Editorial Highlight)

Purpose: Authority + SEO.

Layout:
	•	Light grey background (#F8FAFC)

Content:
	•	ONE very large featured article
	•	Full-width image
	•	Overlay text:
	•	“FEATURED”
	•	Category
	•	Article title
	•	Read time + views
	•	Below: optional secondary articles as compact list

CTA: “All Articles →”

⸻

SECTION 6 — WHY CHOOSE TRAVI

Purpose: Trust, but still visual.

Layout:
	•	White background
	•	3 cards, centered

Cards:
	•	Curated Experiences
	•	Trusted Reviews
	•	Real-Time Updates

Each:
	•	Large icon in brand gradient
	•	Title
	•	Short description

❌ No corporate tone
❌ No long paragraphs

⸻

SECTION 7 — FINAL CTA (Emotional Close)

Purpose: Convert curiosity into action.

Layout:
	•	Full-width brand gradient
	•	Centered content

Content:
	•	Headline:
“Ready to Explore Dubai?”
	•	Subtext:
“Plan your perfect trip with Travi’s curated guides and experiences.”
	•	Buttons:
	•	Primary: Browse Hotels (gold)
	•	Secondary: Explore Attractions (outlined / pink)

⸻

FOOTER (Simple & Dark)
	•	Dark gradient or deep purple background
	•	Logo + short brand sentence
	•	3 columns:
	•	Explore
	•	Discover
	•	Legal

⸻

3. DESIGN RULES (CRITICAL)
	•	❌ No repeated identical sections
	•	❌ No generic grids everywhere
	•	❌ No admin/dashboard UI patterns
	•	✅ Strong vertical rhythm
	•	✅ Editorial spacing
	•	✅ Visual storytelling
	•	✅ Brand gradients everywhere they matter

⸻

4. DELIVERABLE EXPECTATION

The output should look like:
	•	A premium travel brand homepage
	•	Investor-ready
	•	SEO-friendly
	•	Emotional, not mechanical

If something looks like a directory or SaaS dashboard, it is wrong.
