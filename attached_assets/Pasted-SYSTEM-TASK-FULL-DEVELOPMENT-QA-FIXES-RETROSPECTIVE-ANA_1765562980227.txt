SYSTEM TASK: FULL DEVELOPMENT + QA + FIXES RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS

You are required to produce a COMPLETE, FACTUAL, STEP-BY-STEP retrospective
of everything that was done since the beginning of building this system.

This is NOT a summary.
This is a forensic reconstruction of the full engineering effort.

────────────────────────────────
OBJECTIVE
────────────────────────────────

Produce a full development and QA activity report that allows us to:

1. Understand EXACTLY what was built
2. Understand EXACTLY what broke along the way
3. Understand EXACTLY what was fixed
4. Classify the TYPES of fixes
5. Estimate REAL HUMAN TEAM effort (not AI execution time)

This report will be used for:
- Technical valuation
- Investor due diligence
- Internal post-mortem
- Human effort estimation

Accuracy and completeness are mandatory.

────────────────────────────────
SCOPE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
────────────────────────────────

You MUST cover ALL phases from project start until final publish approval, including:

- Initial system architecture
- CMS design decisions
- Permissions & RBAC evolution
- Content editor behavior
- AI generation workflows
- Image handling logic
- RSS ingestion
- Public API exposure
- Security hardening
- QA phases
- Bugs discovered
- Vulnerabilities discovered
- Fixes applied
- Re-tests performed

Nothing may be skipped.

────────────────────────────────
REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE
────────────────────────────────

SECTION 1: PROJECT TIMELINE (CHRONOLOGICAL)

Reconstruct the timeline in phases:

Phase 1: Initial system foundation
- What core systems were built
- Key architectural decisions
- What assumptions were made

Phase 2: Feature expansion
- New content types added
- CMS/editor capabilities expanded
- AI features added
- Image generation introduced

Phase 3: Permission model evolution
- Original roles
- Changes made
- New restrictions added
- Why changes were required

Phase 4: QA discovery phase
- What was tested
- What FAILED
- What edge cases were discovered

Phase 5: Security & data exposure fixes
- Exact vulnerabilities found
- How they were discovered
- Why they were critical
- Exact fixes applied

Phase 6: Regression & verification
- What was re-tested
- What was validated
- What was locked down

Phase 7: Release readiness
- What conditions were required for publish
- What checks passed
- What guarantees are now enforced

────────────────────────────────
SECTION 2: BUGS & FIXES CATALOG

Create a table with:

- Issue category (UI / Backend / Security / Permissions / AI / Data)
- Issue description
- How it manifested
- Severity (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- Fix type:
  • Logic fix
  • Permission enforcement
  • Data sanitization
  • Workflow correction
  • Architectural hardening
- Verification method used

Include ALL discovered issues, including:
- RSS endpoint exposure
- Affiliate link exposure
- Any permission leakage
- Any editor misuse potential
- Any AI failure paths

────────────────────────────────
SECTION 3: FIX CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS

Group fixes into categories:

- Preventive fixes
- Security fixes
- Architectural fixes
- UX safety fixes
- Workflow enforcement fixes

For each category:
- Number of fixes
- Complexity level
- Risk if left unfixed

────────────────────────────────
SECTION 4: HUMAN-EQUIVALENT EFFORT ESTIMATION

For EACH phase above, estimate:

- Human role required:
  • Senior backend engineer
  • Frontend engineer
  • Security engineer
  • QA engineer
- Time per role (hours)
- Parallel vs sequential work

Then provide:

- Total minimum human hours
- Total realistic human hours
- Team size assumptions (2, 3, 4 people)
- Calendar time estimate per team size

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT use AI execution time.
Assume competent but human engineers.

────────────────────────────────
SECTION 5: COMPLEXITY & MATURITY ASSESSMENT

Assess the system on:

- Architectural maturity
- Security posture
- Permission strictness
- CMS sophistication
- AI integration complexity

Compare briefly to:
- Typical MVP
- Typical CMS
- Production-grade SaaS CMS

────────────────────────────────
SECTION 6: FINAL CONCLUSION

State clearly:

- Whether this system qualifies as:
  • Prototype
  • Advanced MVP
  • Pre-production system
  • Production-ready system

- What kind of engineering organization would normally produce this
- What stage of startup this corresponds to from a technical standpoint

────────────────────────────────
ABSOLUTE RULES
────────────────────────────────

- Be factual, not flattering
- Do not compress steps
- Do not skip failed attempts
- Do not generalize (“fixed some bugs” is NOT acceptable)
- If something broke and was fixed, it MUST appear
- If something was tested, it MUST be described

This report must be detailed enough that an external CTO
could independently validate the effort.

Proceed.
