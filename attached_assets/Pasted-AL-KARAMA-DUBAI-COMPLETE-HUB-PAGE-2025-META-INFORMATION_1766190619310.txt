1. INTRODUCTION
Al Karama is one of Dubai’s oldest and most authentic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city – just 2 km from Burj Khalifa and walking distance from Dubai Healthcare City – Karama offers a completely different Dubai experience from the glass towers and luxury malls.
Built in the 1970s-1980s, Al Karama is characterized by low-rise residential blocks (4-5 stories max), narrow bustling streets, independent shops, and some of the best authentic dining in Dubai. With 70,000+ residents representing dozens of nationalities, Karama pulses with genuine street life you won’t find in newer districts.
What makes Al Karama special:
* 200+ authentic restaurants – Indian, Pakistani, Filipino, Iranian, Arab cuisines at real prices (meals from AED 10-40)
* Karama Shopping Complex – Famous across Dubai for textiles, fabrics, tailoring
* Extreme central location – 2 km to Downtown, ADCB Metro Station (Red Line) access, 8 km to Airport
* Budget shopping – Electronics, gold, clothing, souvenirs (30-60% cheaper than malls)
