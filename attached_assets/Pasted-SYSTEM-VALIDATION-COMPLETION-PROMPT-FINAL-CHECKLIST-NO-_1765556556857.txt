SYSTEM VALIDATION & COMPLETION PROMPT – FINAL CHECKLIST (NO QUESTIONS)

You are continuing development of the CMS with expanded roles, permissions, analytics,
and content features as previously discussed.

Before considering the work complete, you MUST verify and CONFIRM
that ALL items below are fully implemented, connected, and working together as one system.

────────────────────────────────
BASELINE CONFIRMATION
────────────────────────────────

The system previously had:
- Roles: admin, editor, viewer
- Basic permissions only

You have now expanded the system.
You must ensure NOTHING from the old system contradicts the new rules.

────────────────────────────────
1) AUTHORS / WRITERS SYSTEM
────────────────────────────────

Ensure the following are implemented:

- Content table includes:
  - authorId (foreign key)
  - author name resolved from users table
- Each article displays:
  - Author name publicly
  - Author linked to profile (if exists)
- Admin can:
  - Create new authors
  - Assign authors to content
- Authors are NOT limited to a single email/user
- Author assignment is logged in audit log
- Author cannot be changed by content-only users

────────────────────────────────
2) USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS (STRICT)
────────────────────────────────

Ensure roles behave EXACTLY as defined:

ADMIN:
- Full access
- Can manage users, permissions, settings, logs

EDITOR:
- Can review content
- Can approve/reject
- Can edit SEO, schema, affiliates
- Cannot change system-level settings

CONTENT WRITER / AUTHOR / CONTRIBUTOR:
- Access ONLY content creation area
- Cannot publish
- Cannot delete
- Cannot see settings, logs, analytics, users
- Cannot access via direct URL
- Cannot access via API
- Locked editor (no layout/design/SEO access)

VIEWER:
- Read-only access if exists
- No creation or editing

All permission checks enforced at:
UI
API
Database / middleware

────────────────────────────────
3) AUDIT LOG SYSTEM (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────

Verify that:

- EVERY action is logged
- Logs are append-only
- Logs cannot be edited, deleted, or disabled
- Logs include:
  - User
  - Role at time of action
  - Timestamp
  - Entity
  - Before/after state
  - IP + user agent

Confirm logs exist for:
- Content creation
- Content edits
- Author assignment
- Permission changes
- Login/logout
- Blocked access attempts
- Image generation
- Publishing actions

Audit logs visible ONLY to admin/system roles.

────────────────────────────────
4) ANALYTICS PANEL (ADMIN ONLY)
────────────────────────────────

Ensure analytics system includes:

- View count per article
- Visitor statistics
- Internal analytics dashboard
- Charts and tables
- Integration with Google Analytics
- Analytics NOT visible to content writers
- Analytics access logged in audit log

────────────────────────────────
5) CONTENT EDITOR (ELEMENTOR-LIKE, LOCKED)
────────────────────────────────

Ensure the editor:

- Works like a word processor
- Preserves design system
- Prevents layout breaking
- Auto-fits images to required sizes
- Has “Generate Image” button:
  - Reads content context
  - Generates image prompt
  - Generates filename, ALT, caption
- Does NOT allow:
  - Custom HTML/CSS/JS
  - Layout or style changes
  - Removing required blocks

────────────────────────────────
6) HOME PAGE & CONTENT DISPLAY
────────────────────────────────

Ensure homepage includes:

- Main featured article (hero)
- Secondary articles grid
- Category sections
- Trending content
- Dynamic content population from CMS
- All links route correctly to content pages

────────────────────────────────
7) HOT ATTRACTIONS SECTION
────────────────────────────────

Ensure:

- Dedicated “Hot Attractions” section exists
- Data pulled from attractions content type
- Each card includes CTA to affiliate booking
- Section is editable via admin CMS
- Clicks tracked (analytics + logs)

────────────────────────────────
8) SYSTEM INTEGRATION CHECK
────────────────────────────────

Verify that:

- Roles, permissions, editor, analytics, logs all work together
- No role can access what it should not
- No feature bypasses permissions
- No action occurs without logging
- No UI element appears without permission
- No API endpoint bypasses rules

────────────────────────────────
FINAL DELIVERY REQUIREMENT
────────────────────────────────

After completion, provide a CLEAR CONFIRMATION LIST:

- [ ] Authors system complete
- [ ] Permissions enforced everywhere
- [ ] Audit log complete and immutable
- [ ] Analytics working and restricted
- [ ] Editor locked and stable
- [ ] Homepage sections working
- [ ] Hot attractions live
- [ ] No security or permission gaps

If ANY checkbox cannot be honestly checked,
the system is NOT ready.

This is a production-grade CMS.
Everything must connect.
Everything must be enforced.
Everything must be logged.
