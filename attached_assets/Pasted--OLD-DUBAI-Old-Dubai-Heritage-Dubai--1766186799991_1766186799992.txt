## **Introduction**

Old Dubai is where it all began. Long before the Burj Khalifa pierced the sky and before Palm Jumeirah reshaped the coastline, there was the **Dubai Creek** — a natural saltwater inlet that transformed a small fishing village into a thriving trading port.

Today, Old Dubai encompasses **10+ historic neighborhoods** on both sides of the Creek: **Deira** (north bank) and **Bur Dubai** (south bank). This is the authentic heart of the city, where you'll find labyrinthine souks overflowing with gold and spices, wind-tower architecture, traditional dhows, and the only parts of Dubai that feel genuinely Arabian.

**What makes Old Dubai special:**
- **Dubai's oldest neighborhoods** (pre-1960s)
- **Authentic Arabian culture** and heritage
- **World's largest Gold Souk** (300+ retailers, 10 tonnes of gold on display)
- **Traditional abra rides** across Dubai Creek (AED 1)
- **Al Fahidi Historical District** (1890s architecture preserved)
- **Real local life** — not tourist artifice
- **Budget-friendly** dining and shopping
- **Cultural museums** and heritage sites

**Old Dubai vs. New Dubai:**  
If Downtown Dubai is all glass and steel, Old Dubai is wind towers and wooden dhows. If Dubai Marina is where tourists go, Old Dubai is where Emiratis remember. This is the **soul of Dubai** — chaotic, colorful, and completely authentic.

- **Gold Souk:** Start at 70% of asking price
