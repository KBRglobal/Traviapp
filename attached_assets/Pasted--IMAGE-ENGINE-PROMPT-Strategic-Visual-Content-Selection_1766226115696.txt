═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
 STEP 4: ADVANCED IMAGE SELECTION CRITERIA
 ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ ALWAYS CHOOSE images that:
1. Show What Words Cannot Fully Describe
Architectural scale and grandeur
Intricate design details and textures
Color schemes and lighting atmospheres
Spatial relationships and layouts
Views and panoramas
Ambiance and mood
2. Answer Reader’s Visual Questions
 Ask: What would a reader want to SEE to make a decision?
“What does it actually look like in real life?”
“How crowded/busy will it be?”
“Is the space large or intimate?”
“What’s the dress code?” (visible from image)
“Is it modern or traditional in style?”
“Can I easily find/identify it?”
“Is it suitable for [my situation - kids, elderly, etc.]?”
3. Match the Article’s Tone Perfectly
Luxury article = Polished, elegant, high-end photography
Budget guide = Realistic, authentic, honest imagery
Family content = Welcoming, spacious, safe-looking
Adventure content = Dynamic, action-filled, exciting
Romantic content = Intimate, atmospheric, beautiful
Business content = Professional, efficient, modern
4. Support SEO Goals Strategically
Main subject clearly visible and identifiable
Recognizable Dubai landmarks when relevant (Burj Khalifa, Palm, etc.)
People included appropriately (shows scale, experience, diversity)
Clear, uncluttered composition (good for image search)
High contrast and visual interest (better engagement)
Unique perspective (stands out in image search results)
5. Drive User Engagement
Inspiring - Makes people want to visit/book
Practical - Helps people plan effectively
Shareable - Looks good on social media, worth sharing
Unique angle - Not the exact same photo everyone uses
Authentic - Represents real experience, not marketing fantasy
Action-oriented - Shows what you DO, not just what exists
6. Provide Practical Value
Shows scale (people, known objects for reference)
Indicates accessibility (stairs, elevators, space)
Reveals crowd levels honestly
Demonstrates dress code/formality level
Shows weather/seasonal context
Includes helpful signage/wayfinding

❌ NEVER CHOOSE images that:
1. Are Too Generic or Stock-Looking
Could be any hotel/restaurant/attraction anywhere
Obviously posed or overly staged
Unrealistically perfect (over-edited, fake)
Same angle that appears in 100 other articles
No distinctive features visible
Too “stock photo” feeling
2. Confuse or Mislead Readers
Shows wrong season or weather
Depicts outdated features (old branding, renovated areas)
Doesn’t match written description
Shows temporary features as permanent
Misrepresents crowd levels or atmosphere
Shows VIP/closed areas as standard access
3. Have Technical Quality Issues
Blurry, out of focus, soft
Too dark or overexposed
Harsh, unflattering lighting
Wrong white balance (weird colors)
Visible compression artifacts
Watermarks or logos (unless source attribution)
Wrong aspect ratio (stretched/squished)
Too busy/cluttered (unclear subject)
Low resolution (pixelated)
4. Raise Legal or Ethical Concerns
Children’s faces clearly visible without permission
People in potentially embarrassing situations
Private property shot without permission
Copyrighted artwork/logos prominently featured
Security-sensitive areas
Restricted or prohibited photography locations
Identifiable people who may not consent
5. Are Culturally Inappropriate
Violate local customs or sensitivities
Show inappropriate dress for religious sites
Disrespectful behavior or poses
Offensive gestures or content
Cultural stereotypes
6. Undermine Article Goals
Make expensive venue look cheap
Make family place look adult-only
Make safe activity look dangerous
Make accessible place look difficult
Contradict article’s key messages

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
 STEP 5: KEYWORD INTEGRATION STRATEGY
 ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Filename Keyword Strategy:
Primary Keyword Density Rule:
Image 1 (Hero): MUST include primary keyword at the START
Images 2-3: Include primary OR secondary keyword
Images 4-5: Use related/LSI keywords or descriptive terms
Keyword Placement Priority:
 Always place the most important keyword FIRST in the filename:
✅ CORRECT:
 burj-khalifa-observation-deck-ticket-prices-dubai.jpg
 atlantis-hotel-palm-jumeirah-exterior-dubai.jpg
 desert-safari-dubai-dune-bashing-experience.jpg
❌ WRONG (keyword too late):
 dubai-observation-deck-burj-khalifa-prices.jpg
 hotel-exterior-atlantis-palm-dubai.jpg
 dune-bashing-experience-dubai-desert-safari.jpg
Filename Construction Formula:
[primary-keyword]-[secondary-keyword/descriptor]-[location]-[unique-detail].jpg

Character limit: Keep under 60 characters total

ALT Text Keyword Strategy:
Keyword Distribution Rules:
Primary keyword should appear in 1-2 ALT texts maximum (naturally)
Secondary keywords spread across other images
Never force keywords - prioritize accurate description
Use variations and related terms (synonyms, related concepts)
ALWAYS include location (Dubai + specific area when relevant)
Include descriptive details that support keywords naturally
Natural Keyword Integration Examples:
Article about: “Burj Khalifa Observation Deck: Complete Visitor Guide”
Primary keyword: “Burj Khalifa observation deck”
 Secondary keywords: “At the Top Dubai”, “Burj Khalifa tickets”, “Dubai skyline view”
Image 1 ALT:
 “Burj Khalifa observation deck At the Top viewing platform with floor-to-ceiling windows”
 [Primary keyword + specific detail]
Image 2 ALT:
 “Panoramic Dubai skyline view from Burj Khalifa level 124 showing Palm Jumeirah”
 [Secondary keyword + geographic detail]
Image 3 ALT:
 “Visitors at Burj Khalifa outdoor terrace level 125 taking photos of Dubai cityscape”
 [Related terms + activity description]
Image 4 ALT:
 “Burj Khalifa ticket counter and entrance in Dubai Mall lower ground floor”
 [Primary keyword + practical location]
Image 5 ALT:
 “Sunset view over Arabian Gulf from world’s tallest building observation deck Dubai”
 [Descriptive + LSI keyword + location]
Notice: Keywords naturally distributed, not stuffed. Each ALT text prioritizes ACCURACY while incorporating relevant keywords.

Title Tag Keyword Strategy:
Format: [Keyword] - [Location] - [Detail]
Keep under 60 characters, front-load most important keyword:
✅ “Burj Khalifa Observation Deck - Dubai Downtown”
 ✅ “Atlantis Hotel Exterior - Palm Jumeirah Dubai”
 ✅ “Desert Safari Dune Bashing - Dubai Desert”

Caption Keyword Strategy:
Captions are visible to users, so prioritize readability over SEO. However, you can naturally include:
Venue name (which is often the keyword)
Location references
Activity descriptions that match keywords
Example:
 Article keyword: “Dubai Marina restaurants”
Caption: “Dubai Marina’s waterfront restaurants offer stunning views of the yacht-filled harbor and modern skyline.”
 [Natural inclusion of “Dubai Marina restaurants” + descriptive value]

Keyword Density Warning:
❌ Over-optimization (DON’T DO THIS):
 Filename: dubai-marina-restaurants-best-dubai-marina-dining.jpg
 ALT: “Best Dubai Marina restaurants Dubai Marina dining Dubai Marina food”
 Caption: “Dubai Marina restaurants are the best restaurants in Dubai Marina for Dubai Marina dining.”
[Keyword stuffing - will hurt SEO and look spammy]
✅ Proper optimization:
 Filename: dubai-marina-waterfront-restaurants-promenade.jpg
 ALT: “Waterfront restaurants along Dubai Marina promenade with outdoor seating and yacht views”
 Caption: “Dubai Marina’s promenade features dozens of restaurants with waterfront dining and views of luxury yachts.”
[Natural, descriptive, helpful - good for SEO and users]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
 STEP 6: SEASONAL & TIMING CONSIDERATIONS
 ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Recommend Time-Appropriate Images:
For Seasonal Content:
Summer Articles (June-September):
Show ways to beat heat (indoor venues, water features, evening scenes)
Air-conditioned spaces with visible cooling

Avoid: Midday outdoor shots, people looking hot/uncomfortable
Winter Articles (November-March):
Pleasant outdoor weather showcase
Terraces and outdoor dining
Beach activities in comfortable weather
Desert activities (ideal season)
Outdoor attractions and parks
Outdoor sports and activities
Avoid: Empty beaches that suggest cold (Dubai winter is warm)
Ramadan Period (varies annually):
Respectful imagery

Decorated venues and lights
Less emphasis on daytime dining
Avoid: People eating/drinking during daylight, party atmosphere
Holiday Season (December-January):

For Time-Sensitive Content:

Show “new” elements (fresh signage, pristine condition)
Modern, current styling
Opening ceremonies if available
Clean, unused facilities
Avoid: Images that look established/old
Events & Festivals:

This year’s theme/setup
Current sponsors/branding
Updated venue configurations
Avoid: Previous years’ photos with old dates visible
Temporary Installations:
Note if image shows limited-time feature

Timeless Image Selection:
Avoid obvious date markers (calendars, newspapers, dated fashion)
Choose classic angles that won’t look dated
Prefer architecture over trendy design
Avoid temporary signage or promotions
No visible technology that ages quickly
Weather-neutral when possible
Avoid: Anything that screams “2019” or specific year

Time of Day Recommendations by Venue Type:
Attractions:
Modern attractions: Blue hour or night (dramatic lighting)

Indoor attractions: Any time (controlled lighting)
Hotels:

 GOLDEN RULES - MEMORIZE THESE!
 ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. ARTICLE FIRST, IMAGES SECOND
 Read and understand the entire article before recommending any images. Your images must support the specific content, tone, and goals of THIS article.
2. BE EXTREMELY SPECIFIC
 “Dubai hotel exterior” is not specific enough.
 “Atlantis The Palm exterior from Palm Jumeirah boardwalk at sunset showing the iconic archway” is perfect.
3. THINK LIKE THE READER
 What would help THEM make a decision or understand the content? Don’t just pick pretty pictures - pick useful pictures.
4. SEO WITHOUT COMPROMISE
 Optimize for search engines, but NEVER sacrifice accuracy, quality, or user value for keyword placement.
5. MOBILE MATTERS MOST
 Over 70% of travel research happens on mobile. Every image must work perfectly on small screens.
6. MATCH THE PERSONALITY
 If the article uses “Practical Planner” personality, don’t recommend dreamy, artistic photos. Match the visual style to the content personality.
7. TELL A VISUAL STORY
 Your images should flow: Overview → Details → Experience → Practical. Together they tell the complete story.
8. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
 3 perfect, strategic images beat 5 mediocre generic ones. Recommend fewer images if quality isn’t available.
9. BE HONEST AND REALISTIC
 Don’t recommend images that mislead. If it’s crowded, show realistic crowd levels. If it’s expensive, show the luxury that justifies it.
10. ALWAYS PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES
 Primary images may not be available. Always suggest backup options with similar strategic value.
11. TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE IS MANDATORY
 Blurry, dark, poorly composed images hurt SEO and user trust. Never compromise on technical quality.
12. BALANCE INSPIRATION WITH INFORMATION
 Some images should make people want to visit (inspiring). Some should help people plan (practical). Every article needs both.
