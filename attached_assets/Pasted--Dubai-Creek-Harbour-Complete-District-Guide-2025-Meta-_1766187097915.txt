At its heart stands the **Dubai Creek Tower** — a structure designed to surpass even the Burj Khalifa and become **the world's tallest building**.

But this isn't just about height records. Dubai Creek Harbour represents Dubai's **next chapter**: a smart city built from scratch with cutting-edge technology, 40+ km of waterfront promenades, yacht marinas, retail districts, cultural spaces, and a vision to become the city's **new iconic address**.
