**Expanded (Hidden, opens on click - 150 words):**


The Museum of the Future in Dubai combines stunning architecture with cutting-edge immersive experiences. The distinctive oval building features Arabic calligraphy designed by artist Mattar bin Lahej, illuminated at night to create a striking landmark on Sheikh Zayed Road.
Inside, seven floors transport visitors through themed environments: a space station in 2071, an Amazon biodiversity library, future wellness technologies, and AI-powered solutions. Each floor blends physical installations with digital projections and soundscapes for an interactive experience.
Perfect for tech enthusiasts, curious travelers, and families with older children, the museum attracts over 1 million visitors annually. Located between Downtown Dubai and DIFC, it’s easily accessible by metro (Emirates Towers station) or taxi. Advanced online booking is strongly recommended as time slots sell out quickly, especially on weekends and during winter season (November-March).
