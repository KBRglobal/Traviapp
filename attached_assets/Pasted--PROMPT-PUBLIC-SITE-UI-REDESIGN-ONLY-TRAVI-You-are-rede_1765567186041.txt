🎨 PROMPT – PUBLIC SITE UI REDESIGN ONLY (TRAVI)

You are redesigning the PUBLIC WEBSITE UI of Travi (Dubai travel platform).

⚠️ STRICT SCOPE
	•	DO NOT touch the CMS / admin system – it is final and out of scope.
	•	DO NOT change APIs, data models, or logic.
	•	This task is UI/UX redesign in code only (React + Tailwind).
	•	No Figma. No new features. No backend changes.

⸻

🎯 GOAL

Transform the public website from a generic template-style site into a premium editorial travel brand.

Target feeling:

Editorial · Premium · Confident · Curated
Similar to: Lonely Planet (editorial), Airbnb (visual rhythm), Apple (hierarchy)

⸻

🔍 CURRENT STATE (ASSUME THIS)
	•	Homepage and all listing pages (Hotels / Attractions / Articles) look almost identical.
	•	Each page starts with a flat colored hero strip + title.
	•	Content is shown as uniform cards in grids.
	•	There is no editorial hierarchy, no rhythm, no featured moments.
	•	Pages differ mostly by color, not structure or storytelling.

⸻

🧭 REDESIGN PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. Hero Sections
	•	Replace flat color heroes with image-based heroes.
	•	Use:
	•	Large background image
	•	Gradient overlays
	•	Clear editorial headline + short subheading
	•	Hero should feel like “entering a story”, not a category label.

⸻

2. Editorial Hierarchy

Introduce visual hierarchy on all pages:
	•	Featured content (larger, dominant)
	•	Secondary content (grid)
	•	Supporting content (text-led or compact cards)

Not everything should look equal.

⸻

3. Listing Pages (Hotels / Attractions / Articles)

Redesign listing pages so they are not just grids:

Required structure:
	•	Featured item at top (large card or split layout)
	•	Then a curated grid
	•	Optional editorial section (short text + CTA)

Each content type should feel different:
	•	Hotels → luxury / premium tone
	•	Attractions → experiential / visual
	•	Articles → editorial / text-forward

⸻

4. Homepage Rhythm

Homepage must have clear section differentiation:
	•	Mix of:
	•	Large visual sections
	•	Calm whitespace sections
	•	Editorial text-led blocks
	•	Avoid repeating the same card layout section after section.

⸻

5. Cards & Components

Improve cards:
	•	Strong image ratios
	•	Better typography hierarchy
	•	Clear CTAs
	•	Subtle hover states
	•	Less “UI kit”, more “magazine”

⸻

6. Typography & Spacing
	•	Increase vertical spacing between sections.
	•	Use typography to lead the eye:
	•	Big headlines
	•	Calm body text
	•	Clear section intros
	•	Reduce visual noise.

⸻

🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
	•	Use existing React components and Tailwind.
