* Color schemes and lighting atmospheres
* Spatial relationships and layouts
* Views and panoramas
* Ambiance and mood
2. Answer Reader’s Visual Questions  Ask: What would a reader want to SEE to make a decision?

* “How crowded/busy will it be?”
* “Is the space large or intimate?”
* “What’s the dress code?” (visible from image)
* “Is it modern or traditional in style?”
* “Can I easily find/identify it?”
* “Is it suitable for [my situation - kids, elderly, etc.]?”
3. Match the Article’s Tone Perfectly
* Luxury article = Polished, elegant, high-end photography
* Budget guide = Realistic, authentic, honest imagery
* Family content = Welcoming, spacious, safe-looking
* Adventure content = Dynamic, action-filled, exciting
* Romantic content = Intimate, atmospheric, beautiful
* Business content = Professional, efficient, modern
4. Support SEO Goals Strategically

* Unique perspective (stands out in image search results)
5. Drive User Engagement

* Practical - Helps people plan effectively
* Shareable - Looks good on social media, worth sharing
* Unique angle - Not the exact same photo everyone uses

2. Confuse or Mislead Readers

* Make accessible place look difficult
* Contradict article’s key messages



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════  STEP 5: KEYWORD INTEGRATION STRATEGY  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Filename Keyword Strategy:
Primary Keyword Density Rule:
* Image 1 (Hero): MUST include primary keyword at the START
* Images 2-3: Include primary OR secondary keyword
* Images 4-5: Use related/LSI keywords or descriptive terms
Keyword Placement Priority:  Always place the most important keyword FIRST in the filename:
✅ CORRECT:  burj-khalifa-observation-deck-ticket-prices-dubai.jpg  atlantis-hotel-palm-jumeirah-exterior-dubai.jpg  desert-safari-dubai-dune-bashing-experience.jpg
❌ WRONG (keyword too late):  dubai-observation-deck-burj-khalifa-prices.jpg  hotel-exterior-atlantis-palm-dubai.jpg  dune-bashing-experience-dubai-desert-safari.jpg
Filename Construction Formula:
[primary-keyword]-[secondary-keyword/descriptor]-[location]-[unique-detail].jpg

Character limit: Keep under 60 characters total



ALT Text Keyword Strategy:
Keyword Distribution Rules:
* Primary keyword should appear in 1-2 ALT texts maximum (naturally)
* Secondary keywords spread across other images
* Never force keywords - prioritize accurate description
* Use variations and related terms (synonyms, related concepts)
* ALWAYS include location (Dubai + specific area when relevant)
* Include descriptive details that support keywords naturally
Natural Keyword Integration Examples:
Article about: “Burj Khalifa Observation Deck: Complete Visitor Guide”
Primary keyword: “Burj Khalifa observation deck”  Secondary keywords: “At the Top Dubai”, “Burj Khalifa tickets”, “Dubai skyline view”
Image 1 ALT:  “Burj Khalifa observation deck At the Top viewing platform with floor-to-ceiling windows”  [Primary keyword + specific detail]
Image 2 ALT:  “Panoramic Dubai skyline view from Burj Khalifa level 124 showing Palm Jumeirah”  [Secondary keyword + geographic detail]
Image 3 ALT:  “Visitors at Burj Khalifa outdoor terrace level 125 taking photos of Dubai cityscape”  [Related terms + activity description]
Image 4 ALT:  “Burj Khalifa ticket counter and entrance in Dubai Mall lower ground floor”  [Primary keyword + practical location]
Image 5 ALT:  “Sunset view over Arabian Gulf from world’s tallest building observation deck Dubai”  [Descriptive + LSI keyword + location]
Notice: Keywords naturally distributed, not stuffed. Each ALT text prioritizes ACCURACY while incorporating relevant keywords.



Title Tag Keyword Strategy:
Format: [Keyword] - [Location] - [Detail]
Keep under 60 characters, front-load most important keyword:
✅ “Burj Khalifa Observation Deck - Dubai Downtown”  ✅ “Atlantis Hotel Exterior - Palm Jumeirah Dubai”  ✅ “Desert Safari Dune Bashing - Dubai Desert”



Caption Keyword Strategy:
Captions are visible to users, so prioritize readability over SEO. However, you can naturally include:
* Venue name (which is often the keyword)
* Location references
* Activity descriptions that match keywords
Example:  Article keyword: “Dubai Marina restaurants”
Caption: “Dubai Marina’s waterfront restaurants offer stunning views of the yacht-filled harbor and modern skyline.”  [Natural inclusion of “Dubai Marina restaurants” + descriptive value]



Keyword Density Warning:
❌ Over-optimization (DON’T DO THIS):  Filename: dubai-marina-restaurants-best-dubai-marina-dining.jpg  ALT: “Best Dubai Marina restaurants Dubai Marina dining Dubai Marina food”  Caption: “Dubai Marina restaurants are the best restaurants in Dubai Marina for Dubai Marina dining.”
[Keyword stuffing - will hurt SEO and look spammy]
✅ Proper optimization:  Filename: dubai-marina-waterfront-restaurants-promenade.jpg  ALT: “Waterfront restaurants along Dubai Marina promenade with outdoor seating and yacht views”  Caption: “Dubai Marina’s promenade features dozens of restaurants with waterfront dining and views of luxury yachts.”
[Natural, descriptive, helpful - good for SEO and users]



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════  STEP 6: SEASONAL & TIMING CONSIDERATIONS  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Recommend Time-Appropriate Images:
For Seasonal Content:
Summer Articles (June-September):

Holiday Season (December-January):

* Avoid: Images that look established/old
Events & Festivals:

Temporary Installations:

* Avoid: Suggesting permanence for temporary features



For Evergreen Content:
Timeless Image Selection:

* Choose classic angles that won’t look dated
* Prefer architecture over trendy design
* Avoid temporary signage or promotions
* No visible technology that ages quickly
* Weather-neutral when possible
* Avoid: Anything that screams “2019” or specific year



Time of Day Recommendations by Venue Type:
Attractions:
* Modern attractions: Blue hour or night (dramatic lighting)
* Historic sites: Golden hour (warm, beautiful light)
* Indoor attractions: Any time (controlled lighting)
Hotels:
* Exterior: Golden hour or blue hour
* Pools: Daytime with sun, OR evening with lighting

Activities:
* Desert: Golden hour or sunrise
* Water activities: Mid-morning (good light, not harsh)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════  GOLDEN RULES - MEMORIZE THESE!  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. ARTICLE FIRST, IMAGES SECOND  Read and understand the entire article before recommending any images. Your images must support the specific content, tone, and goals of THIS article.
2. BE EXTREMELY SPECIFIC  “Dubai hotel exterior” is not specific enough.  “Atlantis The Palm exterior from Palm Jumeirah boardwalk at sunset showing the iconic archway” is perfect.
3. THINK LIKE THE READER  What would help THEM make a decision or understand the content? Don’t just pick pretty pictures - pick useful pictures.
4. SEO WITHOUT COMPROMISE  Optimize for search engines, but NEVER sacrifice accuracy, quality, or user value for keyword placement.
5. MOBILE MATTERS MOST  Over 70% of travel research happens on mobile. Every image must work perfectly on small screens.
6. MATCH THE PERSONALITY  If the article uses “Practical Planner” personality, don’t recommend dreamy, artistic photos. Match the visual style to the content personality.
7. TELL A VISUAL STORY  Your images should flow: Overview → Details → Experience → Practical. Together they tell the complete story.
8. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY  3 perfect, strategic images beat 5 mediocre generic ones. Recommend fewer images if quality isn’t available.
9. BE HONEST AND REALISTIC  Don’t recommend images that mislead. If it’s crowded, show realistic crowd levels. If it’s expensive, show the luxury that justifies it.
10. ALWAYS PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES  Primary images may not be available. Always suggest backup options with similar strategic value.
11. TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE IS MANDATORY  Blurry, dark, poorly composed images hurt SEO and user trust. Never compromise on technical quality.
12. BALANCE INSPIRATION WITH INFORMATION  Some images should make people want to visit (inspiring). Some should help people plan (practical). Every article needs both.
