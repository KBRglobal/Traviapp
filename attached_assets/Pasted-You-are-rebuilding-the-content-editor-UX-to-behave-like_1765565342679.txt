You are rebuilding the content editor UX to behave like Elementor for writers, not a developer form and not a generic CMS.

Core principle (non-negotiable)

This editor must feel visual, block-first, canvas-based, exactly like Elementor / Webflow editor — not like a settings form with fields.

If something feels like “fill inputs and save”, it is wrong.

⸻

Required UX Model (Elementor-like)

1. Canvas-first editing (critical)
	•	The center of the screen is a live page canvas, not a form.
	•	Blocks appear visually stacked, exactly as they will appear on the public page.
	•	Each block is:
	•	Clickable
	•	Editable inline
	•	Highlighted on hover
	•	Shows block controls (move / duplicate / delete) on hover

❌ No “Content Blocks” empty box
❌ No “Add block” dropdown floating alone
✅ Visual page with sections, even when empty (placeholders)

⸻

2. Left panel = Block library (like Elementor)

Replace the current “Add block” dropdown with:
	•	A left-side block panel containing:
	•	Text
	•	Image
	•	Gallery
	•	FAQ
	•	Highlights
	•	Tips
	•	CTA
	•	Info Grid
	•	Blocks are added by:
	•	Click
	•	Drag & drop into canvas

This panel must feel like Elementor’s widget panel.

⸻

3. Right panel = Block settings (contextual)

The right panel must be context-sensitive:
	•	When nothing is selected:
	•	Show Page Settings (status, SEO tab, slug, publish state)
	•	When a block is selected:
	•	Replace panel content with Block Settings
	•	Only settings relevant to that block type

Example:
	•	Image block → image picker, alt text, caption, alignment
	•	Text block → typography, spacing, emphasis
	•	FAQ block → list editor (questions inline, not modal-heavy)

❌ No mixed “Basic Information” form always visible
❌ No static right panel unrelated to selection

⸻

4. Inline editing (very important)
	•	Clicking text lets you type directly in the canvas
	•	No textarea forms for main content
	•	Headings editable inline
	•	Lists editable inline
	•	FAQ questions/answers editable inline

This must feel like writing inside the page, not inside a form.

⸻

5. Hero section must be visual, not fields

The Hero section must NOT be:
	•	“Hero Image URL”
	•	“Hero Image Alt Text” inputs

Instead:
	•	Visual hero block at top
	•	Click image → choose image / generate image
	•	Click title → edit title inline
	•	CTA button editable inline

Think Elementor Hero widget.

⸻

6. Image generation UX (currently broken)

Right now “Generate with AI” is unclear and disconnected.

Fix it like this:
	•	Image blocks have two buttons:
	•	“Upload Image”
	•	“Generate Image with AI”
	•	Clicking “Generate Image”:
	•	Opens a modal
	•	Shows:
	•	What image will be generated (based on block + page context)
	•	3–5 image previews returned
	•	User must explicitly select one
	•	No auto-insert
	•	No background magic

The user must always understand:

“I am generating images for THIS block”

⸻

7. Page must never look empty

When creating a new Attraction:
	•	The canvas should already show:
	•	Hero placeholder
	•	Intro text placeholder
	•	Essential info placeholder
	•	Tips placeholder
	•	FAQ placeholder

These are locked required sections (can’t delete), only edit.

Just like Elementor templates.

⸻

8. Writing experience > configuration

Reduce visible fields to the absolute minimum:
	•	Title
	•	Slug
	•	Status

Everything else belongs inside blocks.

If it feels like “admin panel”, it’s wrong.
If it feels like “website builder”, it’s right.

⸻

9. Visual hierarchy rules
	•	Clear spacing between blocks
	•	Subtle borders or background for blocks on hover
	•	Drag handles visible on hover
	•	Section labels (“Hero”, “FAQ”, etc.) visible only in editor mode

This is an editor, not a preview-only mode.

⸻

10. Success criteria (how you know you did it right)

If a non-technical editor:
	•	Never looks at the left menu after choosing “Attractions”
	•	Writes everything directly on the page
	•	Understands where images go without reading docs

Then the implementation is correct.

⸻

Explicitly out of scope
	•	No code editor
	•	No raw HTML
	•	No markdown editor
	•	No “fill this form then see result later”

⸻

Deliverables
	•	Refactor the editor UI to follow the above UX exactly
	•	Adjust component structure as needed (canvas, block layer, panels)
	•	Do not add features — only change how editing feels
